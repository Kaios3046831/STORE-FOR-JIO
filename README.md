# (Multi-)Store client

This is a WIP app store client for the
[b-hackers store](https://gitlab.com/banana-hackers/store-db).

It is designed to support multiple installation methods and multiple store
backends, so someday it might also be able to install KaiStore apps.

## Source code for `debug-forwarder.bin`

## Icon credits

The icon is based on the B-Hackers Store icon by John-David Deubl (perry), see
